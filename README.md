DIY Minesweeper in C++ &amp; GTKMM
## Raison d'etre
To really learn something, I need a project.  It seems to me that writing
from scratch the classic game Minesweeper might be a worthy challenge.

Everything a drop-in ET would need to know about Minesweeper can be found
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) Reference implementation ) for screen layouts, etc. is [here] (https://minesweeper.online/game/2537423025).  Yes, there is a FOSS version readily available, [Kmines](https://apps.kde.org/kmines/), but the point here is not to **have** the game, but to **create** the game.  From scratch.

My intent is to use [GTKMM] (https://gtkmm.org/en/documentation.html) for the GUI framework.  I'll learn in due course if that's a good choice.

## Tools

I will start with my preferred toolkit: Vim, make, g++.  I will reserve the right to switch to Code, VSCode, Eclipse, ot even Visual Studio, but that is unlikely.
